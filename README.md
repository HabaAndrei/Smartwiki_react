## Environments
The React application is deployed using Nginx.

## Usage Instructions
I recommend creating an account. You can do this with a username and password, but it's much easier to use Google sign-in.
Upon creating an account, you'll receive 10 tokens to test and use the application. Later, you can either subscribe or purchase tokens individually.

## Tech
Smartwiki is a web application composed of three modules: React, node, and AI, each having its own Github repository.

- The React is built with React and Google Firebase.
- Firebase is used for authentication and analytics only.
- Deployed on [smartwiki.site](https://smartwiki.site)


## Application Structure
The frontend objects are divided into Pages and Components.
Users can sign in either with username and password, or with a Google account.
